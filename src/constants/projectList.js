      "Soaring flocks is my portfolio project for Codaisseur. Players take on the role of capitalist birds, and trade and invest their resources. I designed the gameplay in a couple of days, after which the programming started. It is a full stack app, where players can register/login. Every night, players get awarded resources, which they can then freely trade or invest in order to earn more resources. Soaring Flocks also contains a chatbox, built with GraphQL subscriptions. The most challenging part of this project was learning GraphQL from scratch while time was short.",

    description: `Fake ID generator was our group project during the Codaisseur Academy. Using 'travel' as our theme, we wanted to use a face-detection API, where users can add gorgeous and not so gorgeous features to their face. We worked well as a team, as we had the opportunity to be both productive and playful. This project was built in about four days, including concept and design.`,

      "Work in progress. This app helps you create an efficient shopping route in your grocery store. This to increase efficiency (and for me, so I don't get lost). Also helps reduce crowds in supermarkets, so stupid COVID doesn't get its way. In this app, administrators can add grocery stores and products to the database. It is a full stack app to expand my skills while learning TypeScript and TypeGraphQL. When it's done, I will be using it every week to optimize my shopping.",
